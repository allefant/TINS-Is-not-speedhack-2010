  Instructions:
    ESC                       - Quit the game.
    X                         - When in the air, this key transforms the
                                  player into a winged angel.
    Z                         - Jump, flutter.
    Left and Right Arrow keys - Run, lean.


  Special TINS Requirements:
    * Deities & Demigods
        The player is a half-deity, able change into a winged angel for short
        spans of time.  While in this form, the game changes from a standard
        platformer into a sort of Lunar Lander clone - what was previously the
        jump button becomes the 'flap wings' button, and the arrow keys serve
        to tilt the player in either direction.
    * Hand drawn
        All game art was drawn with a computer tablet in a painterly style.
    * Use samples of human(-like) voice
        The sounds in the game are all recorded and modified vocals.
    * Polymorphism
        The game implements two separate control interfaces - one for each
        form that the player may take.
    * View Source
        The words strewn about the world are stored in code as opposed to an
        external file. ( Lame, I know. :X )
