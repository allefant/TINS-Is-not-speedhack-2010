Hi there,

I didn't have time to completely finish making the game, but the bulk of it is here and as far as I know its playable. Whether its fun to play or not is a different matter.

The code should compile straight out of the box with allegro 4.2. I don't think I've used any addons or anything. Just make sure that glob.dat and sequence.dat are somewhere that the executable can see them.


Basically try and get your character to the other side of the board and down the stairs. You can shoot everyone except the screaming guys. You have to land on them and get points etc.

In order to satisfy the polymorphism rule you can be either a good guy or a bad guy. There is also a screen to choose the AI for the enemies. You *can* give them the second AI, its just that theres really no point cause it doesn't do anything, I didn't have the time to complete it. 

Space is shoot. You can collect more ammo from crates as you go round. The rooms will keep automatically producing themselves, so they don't run out. However, given the time I had to do that bit in (about 4 o'clock this morning having not slept the night before at all) I can't promise that the levels it produces will be any good.

Anyway, now that I've completely rubbished my own work, enjoy.
