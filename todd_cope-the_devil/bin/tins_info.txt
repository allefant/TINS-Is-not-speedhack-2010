The Devil TINS 2010 Info
------------------------

The Devil is built using Allegro 4.9.21 and uses the audio, audio codec, image
I/O, primitives, and font add-ons.

Reused code: T^3 Framework v0.88 (all the stuff in the "t3f" directory)

             makefiles (these were copied from another project)
             
             Not code but the font file ("data/default_font.png") came from
             another project.
             
             The included config file ("allegro.cfg") was copied from another
             project.


Building from Source
--------------------

	Linux
	-----
	
	From the "src" directory type:
	
		make -f makefile.linux

	The binary will be produced in the "bin" directory and should be run from
	there.
	
	Windows
	-------
	
	Windows binaries are provided but if you want to build under Windows a
	makefile is included. From the "src" diectory type:
	
		make -f makefile.mingw
	
	The binary will be produced in the "bin" directory and should be run from
	there.
	

	Mac OS X
	--------
	
	To build on Mac OS X you will have to modify one of the makefiles to provide
	the Mac-specific options that pertain to your installed development
	environment.


Notes for Reviewers
-------------------

The game is pretty hard-core so you might have trouble finishing it. There is an
easy mode but some players might even find that too hard. It is important that
you finish the game, though, to see how I've met the requirements so I've
provided a few command-line options that will help you.

	-goobers:   Start the game with 99 lives.
	-firepower: Start the game with triple shot.
	-finale:    Start the game on the last level.
